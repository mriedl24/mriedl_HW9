Business Analytics Student Survey

Project Description

This project is to create a web-based survey designed to collect information from Business Analytics students. It includes questions about home country, home state, and impressions of the BAIS major. The goal is to help the department better understand its students and improve the program.

Best Practices for Web Forms

To make the form easy to use and reliable, several best practices were followed:

Clear Labels and Instructions - Each field has a clear label so users know what information to enter. Tooltips provide extra guidance where needed.

Required Fields and Input Validation - The form uses the required attribute to make sure all necessary fields are filled out before submission, helping to prevent incomplete or incorrect entries.

Logical Layout - Fields are grouped in a logical order to make the form easy to follow. Spacing and alignment keep it clean and readable.

Dropdown Menus for Standardized Inputs - Using <select> elements for fields like "home state" helps ensure consistent responses and reduces mistakes.

Helpful Error Prevention - Placeholder text is avoided in favor of proper labels, and error messages guide users when needed.

Accessibility Considerations

The form is designed to be accessible for all users:

Proper Labeling - Each field has a <label> so screen readers can properly announce them. Tooltips provide extra help where needed.

Keyboard Navigation - Users can complete the form using only the keyboard, and the autofocus attribute makes navigation easier.

Readable Design - The form uses high contrast and a simple layout to make it easy to read. Bootstrapâ€™s form-control and form-select classes ensure consistent sizing and spacing.

By following these practices, the survey is user-friendly and accessible to everyone.
